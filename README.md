# tiny_religion.js
Javascript port of my [old LudumDare23 game](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=11227)

It's just a bunch of static files and an index.html. There's a node static.js server that you can run (uses express.js) to set it up locally (it would work straight from the disk if it wasn't for cross-origin policies).
